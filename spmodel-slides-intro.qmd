## What is `spmodel`?

`spmodel` is an `R` package to fit, summarize, and predict for a variety of spatial statistical models. Some features:

::: {.incremental}

* Fit spatial linear and generalized linear models for point-referenced data; geostatistical models; distance
* Fit spatial linear and generalized linear models for areal (lattice) data; autoregressive models; neighbors
* Compare model fits and inspect model diagnostics
* Predict at unobserved spatial locations (i.e., Kriging)
* And much more!

:::

## Why use `spmodel`?

There are many great spatial modeling packages in `R`. A few reasons to use `spmodel` for spatial analysis are that:

::: {.incremental}

* `spmodel` syntax is similar to base `R` syntax for functions like `lm()`, `glm()`, `summary()`, and `predict()`, making the transition from fitting non-spatial models to spatial models relatively seamless.
* There are a wide variety of `spmodel` capabilities that give the user significant control over the specific spatial model being fit.
* `spmodel` is compatible with other modern `R` packages like `broom` and `sf`.

# A Basic Overview

## Goals

::: goals

1. Fit a spatial linear model using `splm()`.
2. Tidy, glance at, and augment the fitted model.
3. Predict for unobserved locations (i.e., Kriging).
4. Explore other `spmodel` features and provide resources to learn more

:::

## The Sulfate Data

The `sulfate` data in `spmodel` contains data on 197 sulfate measurements in the continental United States

```{r}
head(sulfate)
```

## The Sulfate Data

```{r}
#| label: fig-sulfate
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of sulfate data."
#| echo: false

ggplot(sulfate, aes(color = sulfate)) +
  geom_sf(size = 3) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(limits = c(0, 45)) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 18)
```

## Fitting a Non-Spatial Model

We fit and summarize a non-spatial linear model with an intercept by running

```{r}
lmod <- lm(sulfate ~ 1, data = sulfate)
summary(lmod)
```

## Fitting a Spatial Model

We fit and summarize a spatial linear model with an intercept by running
```{r}
spmod <- splm(sulfate ~ 1, data = sulfate, spcov_type = "exponential")
summary(spmod)
```

## The `broom` Functions

Tidy the fixed effect output

```{r}
tidy(spmod)
```

Glance at the model fit

```{r}
glance(spmod)
```

## The `broom` Functions

Augment the data with model diagnostics

```{r}
augment(spmod)
```

## The Sulfate Prediction Data

The `sulfate_preds` data contains 100 locations at which to predict sulfate

```{r}
head(sulfate_preds)
```

## The Sulfate Prediction Data

```{r}
#| label: fig-sulfate-with-pred
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of sulfate data and prediction locations."
#| echo: false

ggplot(sulfate, aes(color = sulfate)) +
  geom_sf(size = 3) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(limits = c(0, 45)) +
  geom_sf(data = sulfate_preds, size = 2, pch = 17, color = "red") +
  theme_gray(base_size = 18)
```


## Prediction (i.e., Kriging)

```{r}
#| results: hide

predict(spmod, newdata = sulfate_preds)
```

Augment prediction data

```{r}
augment(spmod, newdata = sulfate_preds)
```

## Prediction (i.e., Kriging)

Visualize predictions

```{r}
#| label: fig-sulfate-pred
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of sulfate data predictions."
#| echo: false

aug_preds <- augment(spmod, newdata = sulfate_preds)
ggplot(aug_preds, aes(color = .fitted)) +
  geom_sf(size = 3) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(limits = c(0, 45)) +
  theme_gray(base_size = 18)
```

## Other Features

Other `spmodel` features include:

::: {.incremental}
1. Support for fixing spatial covariance parameters, non-spatial random effects, anisotropy, and large data sets [@hoef2023indexing]
1. Support for areal (i.e., lattice) data (`spautor()`)
1. Simulating spatially-dependent data from various response distributions (e.g., `sprnorm()`)
1. Spatial generalized linear models [@hoef2023marginal]
1. Much more!

## The Moose Data

The moose data in `spmodel` contains data on 218 observations of moose presence/absence in Alaska, USA

```{r}
head(moose)
```

## The Moose Data

Visualize presence/absence data

```{r}
#| label: fig-moose
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of moose presence/abscence."
#| echo: false

ggplot(moose, aes(fill = presence)) +
  geom_sf(size = 3, pch = 21, color = "black") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = "presence") +
  theme_gray(base_size = 18) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(62.6, 63.6, length.out = 5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-148.5, -146, length.out = 3))
```

## Fitting a Non-Spatial Generalized Linear Model

Model moose presence as a function of elevation, strata, and their interaction

```{r}
#| output-location: slide
gmod <- glm(presence ~ elev * strat, family = binomial, 
            data = moose)
summary(gmod)
```

## Fitting a Spatial Generalized Linear Model

```{r}
#| output-location: slide
spgmod <- spglm(presence ~ elev * strat, family = binomial, 
            data = moose, spcov_type = "matern")
summary(spgmod)
```

* Also for `spgautor()`
